**A minimal CI wrapper for [joohoi/acme-dns](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns), delivering up-to-date, multi-arch Docker images via GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).**

## ‚ú® Overview

This repository provides a lightweight continuous integration setup that periodically builds the latest version of `acme-dns` and publishes Docker images to [ghcr.io](https://ghcr.io).
While the upstream `acme-dns` project offers Docker images, they are only published to Docker Hub and are not frequently updated. This project bridges that gap with:

- ‚úÖ **Frequent builds** to keep up with the latest `main` branch changes
- üì¶ **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** support (specifically: much higher rate limits compared to Docker Hub without an account)
- üß¨ **Multi-architecture images** for `amd64` and `arm64` (possibly more in the future)

## üê≥ Image Details

The Docker image is published under:

```
ghcr.io/certonaut/acme-dns-ci
```

### Supported Architectures

- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

Additional architectures may be supported in the future.

### Tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `latest` | Continuously built from the latest upstream `main`/`master` branch |
| `<commit-sha>` | SHA-tagged image matching the upstream commit |
| `v<version>` | Latest build for acme-dns upstream version `version` |
| `vX.Y+<short-sha>` | Tagged "dirty" commits based upon a tag |

## üöÄ Usage

You can use the image just like the upstream one:

```bash
docker run --rm --name acmedns                 \
 -p 53:53                                      \
 -p 53:53/udp                                  \
 -p 80:80                                      \
 -v /path/to/your/config:/etc/acme-dns:ro      \
 -v /path/to/your/data:/var/lib/acme-dns       \
 -d ghcr.io/certonaut/acme-dns-ci
```

To use a specific version or commit:

```bash
# Specific upstream version
docker run ghcr.io/certonaut/acme-dns-ci:v1.1

# Specific upstream commit
docker run ghcr.io/certonaut/acme-dns-ci:9fabc123

# Dirty version (commit after tag)
docker run ghcr.io/certonaut/acme-dns-ci:v1.0+9fabc12
```

> **Note:** This image mirrors the upstream repository as-is. For configuration and usage, refer to the [official acme-dns documentation](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns).

## üîÑ Update Frequency

Images are built on a schedule (currently weekly). This ensures the image stays current with the latest improvements, even if acme-dns doesn't publish new releases.

## ü§ù Contributing
